Zeldes, Amir (2017) "The GUM Corpus: Creating Multilayer Resources in the Classroom". Language Resources and Evaluation 51(3), 581â€“612.


a corpus of English texts from eight text types: interviews, news, travel guides, how-to guides, academic writing, biographies, fiction, online forum discussions.

For the DISRPT 2019 shared task on elementary discourse unit segmentation, only the 7 open text genres are included (to obtain data in the 8th genre, containing reddit forum discussions which is not included in the shared task, see the corpus website). The data follows the normal division into train, test and dev partitions used for other tasks (e.g. for the conll shared task on UD parsing).
